# App-Improvement
## Question: Pick any app on your phone and suggest the Top 2-3 product features/changes you would like to bring to it. Also, talk about what metrics will they move if they are implemented.

**Solution:**
I use multiple apps however, Netflix's App stands out for its clean, user-friendly design. The absence of ratings, while initially odd, cleverly promotes personal content discovery. Their personalized recommendations are smart and effective. While I appreciate many features, I've noticed some missing elements, which I'll discuss next. Overall, Netflix's app offers an excellent, frills-free streaming experience.

**App: Netflix (Android Version)**

**Goal** of the company or app can be to increase retention, time spent on the app/watching
(engagement) or conversions (from free to paid), referrals, etc. The key to all this is to
increase the utility of customers and increase quality engagement. So, I pick **engagement** as
the goal.

**Goal: To increase user engagement, the average time people spend on the Netflix app
(productively, not just for looking at what they want to watch)**

When we talk about improvements or changes in the product, I think it is better to have a
a particular type of user category in mind as each user category shares similar likes and tastes,
and different categories may have different utility for a feature or even the product. Now,
when I think about the type of users, they can be best categorised into 4 categories
according to age considering the similarity in their goals and characteristics:

**1.** 5-15: Kids and early teens (Content restriction).

**2.** 15-30: High school/college students, young professionals (Technology Savvy, open to try
new things).

**3.** 30 - 50: Mid-Senior level professionals (Have developed their tastes, not too tech
savvy and relatively averse to trials

**4.** 50+: Senior Professionals, retired people (Very limited technical knowledge, averse to
new things have already developed tastes)

Out of all these categories, I would like to choose the 2nd category of 15-30 because of the
favourable characteristics of this population. They are open to trying out new stuff and are
tech savvy which forms ideal ground for Netflix. Additionally, they form a significant portion of
netflix current viewers. So, working in this direction not only leads to more adoption but also
better customer experience for current users (leading to more renewals)

**User Segment: 14-30 years of age**

Let’s talk more about the characteristics, aspirations and values of our target user segment to
identify the improvements.
Some of them are: <br>● Open to new stuff, challenges and views <br>● Tech savvy <br>● Strong presence on social media <br>● Influenced a lot by peers and friends <br>● Not too much money to spend<br>

Netflix has worked more or less centric on each of these characteristics. The content provides
alternate views and unconventional views and shows like House of Cards (you may not
agree!), have provided agility of using it on different technologies - Laptop, Phone, Tablet,
Smart TVs, etc. They have also considered several steps regarding the ideal pricing
structure for them and customers alike. But, it doesn’t seem they have delivered much on 2
grounds, focussing on the user’s strong affection for social media presence and the influence
their friends and peers have on their decisions, tastes, etc. I would like to focus on use cases
related to these 2 only.
Because their friends and peers are also connected to them on social media,
it is safe to assume that the more a person is connected to social media, the more a person
is probable to be connected to the real world. It may not be true in some cases, say when
the other person is not present or for a bunch of other reasons, but this assumption will
simplify our thought process as you see later.

**Use Case Category: Strong presence on social media of user and their peers**

Now, let's delve deep into the particular ways we can focus on this trait.  I generally watch a TV series on some friend’s recommendation or if it is trending
on Facebook, in the sense of a large number of references to the storylines, dialogues,
references, video frames and above all, memes!
But this is all for me, lets pick up a framework to avoid any personal bias and avoid leaving any
important component of interest. When we look at the reasons why people use any social
media platform, say Facebook, it is due to the following reasons:
<br>● Updates on friend’s activities, and life events <br>● Keeping up with the trend (news, movements, fashion, culture, etc) <br>● Communication (personalised chats and groups) <br>● Share personal views<be>

Netflix can leverage the points mentioned above (as it does get Facebook data of users) to
help in these types of use cases:
**Use Cases:**
**1.** I am not sure what movie/TV series to watch. I am a bit tired of the
recommendation system. Me too is so a heated topic, I wish I could watch some
of it. I wonder what my friends have watched/ watching? What type of shows
do the Dance Cub guys watch, I wish I could know.
**2.** Wow, that’s funny! I could create a meme out of it. Hmm.. too much work,
will do it later. (That later never comes!)
**3.** Wow, I need to share this dialogue with Frank Underwood, but wouldn’t that be
too stupid? Forget, let me keep the intelligence to me :P

Based on these cases, we can come up with the following features. I will provide the details
of these features, what feature should be prioritised and how to check if the feature is
working as we expect. Also, I discovered a strong reason to push feature 3 which I will discuss
later.
**Features:**
**1.** Recommendation system based on user's social media friends, groups, pages
and trends they are following
**2.** Social profile of users provided by Spotify to share what they have
watched/watching, planning to watch, their My List, etc.
**3.** Sharing Netflix to social media through dialogues, video frames and memes.

**Features in Detail:**
Now, let’s talk about each feature in more detail. 

The recommendation feature first. Netflix
can identify the trends and interests of the user in a particular time frame from the user’s
activity on Facebook, the friends, the groups and pages one follows and comes up with highly
personalised recommendation list, which also factors the time factor as user interests can be
changing over time (especially in this user segment). But, I am a bit sceptical if Netflix is
doing it now or not, I couldn’t find exactly about their use of social media data for
recommendations but it seems highly probable they have already inculcated it in some form,
if not, go for it Netflix!

Secondly, the social profile on Netflix. This is a bit similar to Spotify’s activity feed where I
can follow my Facebook friends' avatars on Spotify and can know what they are listening/ have
listened to and their playlists. A similar thing for Netflix would give the watched Shows, Movies
and their My List item. We can provide an option of what the user doesn’t want to show in
his/her avatar.

The third and most innovative of all is the Share Netflix on Social Media Feature. I have tried to
provide a rough idea in the picture below. Her e, the bar marked as one will give the number
of posts (dialogues, video frames and memes) posted on various social media platforms for
a particular episode/ season or series. The second feature provides an option to share either
the dialogue that is present in the current frame, the video frame itself and ‘share and create
meme’ where Netflix can provide a small additional pop-up to do small edits on the frame
and allow it to post directly on various social media platforms.


**Metrics to compare the 3 features:**
If I have to decide on only one of the features or priority of features to implement, I would try
to look for some metrics on which I compare each feature and then provide a preference. I
have considered the following metrics and also highlighted the limitations of each below. I
have ranked each feature as **High, Medium/Moderate, and Low** on each metric.
The first is **user engagement**. The recommendation would surely be good but it may be already
incorporated. So, it will score a **Medium** rank. In comparison to this, the social avatar would
be **Low** and **High** for sharing on Netflix, the reason being that it would encourage users to watch
series more and come back for other series or seasons if they received a good reaction on
social media. Also, the stats of sharing will make them feel okay and they are not doing
something stupid. On the reverse side, if they don’t get much positive reaction, will they
blame Netflix for it? It would be more on social media and then the person will mostly return
to the series or try other series. In either series, it seems like a win-win.
The second is technical complexity in implementation. The recommendation system would be **High**
owing to changes required in the current recommendation system and using additional APIs and
features in existing algorithms. Social avatar is a **Low** and the share feature would be
**Moderate**.

In terms of time to unroll, it would be High for recommendations, low for Netflix profile and
medium for the share feature, keeping in mind the time to develop, get the legal cleared with
social media platforms and developing policies.
Talking about limitations, Recommendations could significantly alter the current
recommendation system which may be detrimental if not done properly posing high risks.
Social avatar would be a new add-on but lacks grace and user attention compared to other
features but would be safe to just dock out in case of any errors. The share on social feature
will be linked to the video player and may cause issues with the player if any issue arise, in
addition to constraints of data use in each case.

**Based on this, I would recommend Share Netflix on Social media as the most
promising feature, followed by Social avatar and recommendations.**

**Metrics to look upon:**
These metrics can provide insight into the ultimate goal which is user engagement and how
this leads to conversion to paid subscribers:
<br>● Average time spent watching <br>● Average number of shows watched <br>● Number of Social engagements: Number of shares from Netflix to various social
platforms <br>● We can use econometrics models to identify how these features affect the first
two metrics to identify how successful the feature has been <br>● And finally, retention rate<br>
