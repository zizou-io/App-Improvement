# App-Improvement
## Question: Pick any app on your phone and suggest the Top 2-3 product features/changes you would like to bring to it. Also, talk about what metrics will they move if they are implemented.

**Solution:**
I use multiple apps however, Netflix's App stands out for its clean, user-friendly design. The absence of ratings, while initially odd, cleverly promotes personal content discovery. Their personalized recommendations are smart and effective. While I appreciate many features, I've noticed some missing element, which I'll discuss next. Overall, Netflix's app offers an excellent, frills-free streaming experience.

**App: Netflix (Android Version)**

**Goal** of the company or app can be to increase retention, time spent on app/watching
(engagement) or conversions (from free to paid), referrals, etc. The key to all this is to
increase the utility of customers and increase quality engagement. So, I pick **engagement** as
the goal.

**Goal: To increase user engagement, the average time people spend on Netflix app
(productively, not just for looking at what they want to watch)**

When we talk about improvements or changes in the product, I think it is better to have a
particular type of user category in mind as each user category share similar likes and tastes,
and different categories may have different utility for a feature or even the product. Now,
when I think about the type of users, they can be best categorised into 4 categories
according to age considering the similarity in their goals and characteristics:

**1.** 5-15: Kids and early teens (Content restriction).

**2.** 15-30: High school/college students, young professionals (Technology Savvy, open to try
new things).

**3.** 30 - 50: Mid-Senior level professionals (Have developed their own tastes, not too tech
savvy and relatively averse to trials

**4.** 50+: Senior Professionals, retired people (Very limited technical knowledge, averse to
new things have already developed tastes)

Out of all these categories, I would like to choose the 2nd category of 15-30 because of the
favourable characteristics of this population. They are open to trying out new stuff and are
tech savvy which forms ideal ground for Netflix. Additionally, they form a significant portion of
netflix current viewers. So, working in this direction not only leads to more adoption but also
better customer experience for current users (leading to more renewals)

**User Segment: 14-30 years of age**

Let’s talk more about the characteristics, aspirations and values of our target user segment to
identify the improvements.
Some of them are: <br>● Open to new stuff, challenges and views <br>● Tech savvy <br>● Strong presence on social media <br>● Influenced a lot by peers and friends <br>● Not too much money to spend<br>

Netflix has worked more or less centric on each of these characteristics. The content provides
alternate views and unconventional views and shows like House of Cards (you may not
agree!), have provided agility of using it on different technologies-Laptop, Phone, Tablet,
Smart TVs, etc. They have also considered several steps regarding the ideal pricing
structure for them and customers alike. But, it doesn’t seem they have delivered much on 2
grounds, focussing on the user’s strong affection for social media presence and the influence
their friends and peers have on their decisions, tastes, etc. I would like to focus on use cases
related to these 2 only.
Because their friends and peers are also connected to them on social media,
it is safe to assume that the more a person is connected to social media, the more a person
is probable to be connected to the real world. It may not be true in some cases, say when
the other person is not present or for a bunch of other reasons, but this assumption will
simplify our thought process as you see later.

**Use Case Category: Strong presence on social media of user and their peers**

Now, let's delve deep into the particular ways we can focus on this trait. Talking about
myself, I generally watches a TV series on some friend’s recommendation or if it is trending
on facebook, in the sense of large number of reference to the storylines, dialogues,
references, video frames and above all, memes!
But this all for me, lets pick up a framework to avoid any personal bias and avoid leaving any
important component of interest. When we look at the reasons why people use any social
media platform, say facebook, it is due to the following reasons:
<br>● Updates on friend’s activities, life events <br>● Keeping up with the trend (news, movements, fashion, cultural, etc) <br>● Communication (personalised chats and groups) <br>● Share personal views<br>
